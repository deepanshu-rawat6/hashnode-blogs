Want to upgrade Grafana, but worried about loosing alerts configuration?

Setting up Grafana alerts manually can be the repetitive, although it’s a one time step, but there can be more than hundreds of alerts. But what if you wanna upgrade Grafana? The alerts are stored in the `grafana.db` which is present at `/var/lib/grafana`. On upgrading the current DB configs can be lost.

A better way of managing the alerts can be using `GitHub` to keep the manage alerts as code and deploy them to the new Grafana using `terraform`.

## Introduction

Grafana is a popular open-source observability platform used for **visualizing metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**. It has become the go-to platform for **DevOps**, **SRE** folks for build real-time dashboards, because of it’s integration with multiple data sources (Prometheus, AWS Cloudwatch, AWS Athena…).

Today, we’ll talk about it’s alerting mechanism.

Grafana’s alerting system notifies users when defined thresholds are breached. Alerts are created directly on panels or independently via **Grafana Alerting**, introduced in newer versions. We can group alerts into **contact points** and **notification policies** for better management.

## Why Manual Grafana Alert Management fails?

While setting up alerts manually in Grafana might seem like a one-time task, it often turns into a repetitive and error-prone process as if there’s manual efforts the changes of error significantly increase, especially in dynamic or critical environments.

### Alerts stored in grafana.db

Grafana stores all manually created dashboards, alerts, contact points, and alert rules in a file-based SQLite database called `grafana.db`**.**

The database resides at:

```bash
/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db
```

If this file is **overwritten**, **deleted**, or not restored correctly during a migration or upgrade, all alert configurations are lost.

### **Risks During Upgrades**

* During minor version upgrades, structural changes in the database might corrupt or remove existing alert configurations.
    
* Recreating alerts manually is **time-consuming**, prone to **human error**, and hard to maintain across multiple environments (e.g., staging and production).
    

## Introducing GitOps for Grafana Alerts

#### **What is GitOps?**

**GitOps** is a modern infrastructure management approach where **Git** acts as the single source of truth for your infrastructure and application configurations.  
Instead of manually configuring systems like Grafana, you define everything as code (e.g., in YAML, HCL, JSON), store it in Git, and use automation tools to deploy and sync changes to your environments.

In GitOps workflows:

* All changes are made via **pull requests** (PRs).
    
* You gain **auditability**, **traceability**, and **reproducibility**.
    
* Automation ensures consistency across dev, qa, stage, and prod environments.
    

#### **Why Apply GitOps to Grafana Alerts?**

Managing Grafana alerts manually may work at small scale, but as teams grow and environments become more complex, it becomes essential to handle alert rules just like application code.

By treating **Grafana alerts as code**, you unlock several key benefits:

* Version Control with GitHub
    
    * All alert definitions live in a Git repository.
        
    * Every change is tracked with commit history.
        
    * You can easily review who changed what and when.
        
* Team Collaboration
    
    * Teams can collaborate through pull requests and code reviews.
        
* Easy Rollback and History
    
    * If a change causes false positives or alert fatigue, you can roll back to a previous state instantly.
        
    * Compare current alerts with historical definitions using Git diffs.
        
* Automated Deployment
    
    * Changes to alert definitions can be automatically deployed using **CI/CD pipelines**.
        
    * Promotes **consistency** across environments and **reduces human error**.
        

## Terraform for Grafana Alert Provisioning

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that allows you to provision and manage infrastructure components using declarative configuration files.

While it's commonly used for cloud infrastructure (like AWS, GCP), it also supports third-party tools like **Grafana** through its **Terraform Provider**.

Using Terraform to manage **Grafana alerts** enables you to codify your alert rules, store them in version control (e.g., GitHub), and apply changes consistently across environments.

### **Overview of Using Terraform with Grafana**

* With the **Grafana Terraform provider**, you can define:
    
    * Dashboards
        
    * Alert rules (using Unified Alerting system)
        
    * Notification channels (contact points)
        
    * Folders, data sources, and more
        
* This enables you to **manage Grafana configurations programmatically**, rather than clicking through the UI.
    

### Outline of the Grafana Alert module

```bash
➜  grafana-alerts git:(fb) tree
.
├── {env}-alerts
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── provider.tf
....
├── main.tf
├── provider.tf
└── vars.tf
├── outputs.tf
```

### Required Setup

#### Grafana Provider in Terraform

In order to interact with Grafana, we need to declare the Grafana provider in the `provider.tf` :

```bash
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13.5"
  required_providers {
    grafana = {
      source  = "grafana/grafana"
      version = "3.22.0"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "grafana" {
  url  = "<GRAFANA_URL>"
  auth = GRAFANA_API_KEY
  # auth = "admin:admin"
}
```

* Replace `url` with your Grafana instance address.
    
* The `auth` field takes a **Grafana API token** with appropriate permissions or use `admin:admin` in case, deploying a new Grafana server(please change the initial password after deployment)
    

#### Authentication / Token Setup

* Go to Grafana → Administration → Users and Access → Service Accounts
    
* Create a new service account
    
* Give it a display name with appropriate permissions.
    
* Go back the the `Service Accounts` → Add Token
    
* Give it a display name and set expiration date → Generate Token.
    
* Use this token in your Terraform provider block to authenticate.
    

#### Managing Dashboards and Alert Rules

Once the provider is configured, you can define your alerts like this:

```bash
resource "grafana_rule_group" "cpu_alerts" {
  name     = "CPU Alerts"
  folder   = "Alerting"
  interval = "1m"

  rule {
    name    = "High CPU Usage"
    condition = "C > 80"
    data {
      ref_id = "A"
      relative_time_range {
        from = 600
        to   = 0
      }
      datasource_uid = "prometheus"
      model = jsonencode({
        expr = "100 - (avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[5m])) * 100)"
        interval = ""
        legendFormat = "{{instance}}"
        refId = "A"
      })
    }

    no_data_state = "NoData"
    exec_err_state = "Error"
    for = "2m"

    notification {
      uid = grafana_contact_point.slack.id
    }
  }
}
```

This rule group:

* Checks CPU usage via Prometheus
    
* Alerts if it exceeds 80% for 2 minutes
    
* Sends a notification via a contact point (like Slack)
    

You can also define:

* `grafana_contact_point` – to specify where alerts go
    
* `grafana_dashboard` – for provisioning dashboards
    
* `grafana_folder` – to organize dashboards and alerts
    

## Step-by-Step: Managing Grafana Alerts as Code

Managing Grafana alerts manually becomes unsustainable at scale. Here's how you can **treat alerts as code**, version them in GitHub, and deploy them using **Terraform** and CI/CD pipelines.

### **Step 1:** Export or define existing alerts in Terraform format.

* If you already have alerts in Grafana, then you can export them into `json`, `hcl` and `yaml` format.
    
    ```bash
        curl -s "$GRAFANA_URL/api/ruler/grafana/api/v1/export/rules?format=json&folderUid=$folder_uid" -H "Authorization: $AUTH_TOKEN" > ./$env/$output_file.json
        curl -s "$GRAFANA_URL/api/ruler/grafana/api/v1/export/rules?format=yaml&folderUid=$folder_uid" -H "Authorization: $AUTH_TOKEN"> ./$env/$output_file.yaml
        curl -s "$GRAFANA_URL/api/ruler/grafana/api/v1/export/rules?format=hcl&folderUid=$folder_uid" -H "Authorization: $AUTH_TOKEN"> ./$env/$output_file.hcl
    ```
    
    Make sure populating the environment variables:
    
    * GRAFANA\_URL
        
    * folder\_uid
        
    * AUTH\_TOKEN
        
    * env
        
    * output\_file
        

### **Step 2: Store Them in a GitHub Repository**

* Once your alert rules are written in Terraform:
    
    * Push them into a GitHub repository (or any Git-based version control system).
        
* Structure the repository(as suggested earlier)
    

### **Step 3: Write Terraform Configuration to Define Alerts**

* Use the `grafana_rule_group`, `grafana_contact_point`, and `grafana_folder` resources to define:
    
    * Alert conditions (e.g., CPU usage &gt; 80%)
        
    * Notification channels (e.g., Slack, Email)
        
    * Grouping and timing logic
        

### **Step 4: Automate via CI/CD**

* Integrate Terraform into a **CI/CD pipeline** using tools like Jenkins. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or Argo CD.

## Handling Grafana Upgrades Safely

Upgrading Grafana or migrating infrastructure can wipe alert configurations stored in `grafana.db`. This makes manual setups fragile and risky.

By managing alerts as code with **Terraform**:

* You can **re-deploy alerts instantly** after upgrades or restarts.
    
* No need to reconfigure anything manually.
    
* Ensures **consistent alerting rules** across dev, staging, and production.
    
* Makes your setup **resilient, portable, and upgrade-proof**.
    

This approach brings stability and peace of mind to your monitoring stack.

## Best Practices

### Keeping alerts modular and reusable

Always adopt the practice of modularization of alerts into `child-modules`.

```bash
➜  grafana-alerts git:(fb) tree
.
├── {env}-alerts
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── provider.tf
....
├── main.tf
├── provider.tf
└── vars.tf
├── outputs.tf
```

Here, our `{env}-alerts`, is the `child` of the `parent-module`(grafana-alerts)

#### Note:

While using child-modules, somehow terraform failed to detect the `grafana-provider` defined in the parent directory, so I had to define `provider.tf` for child modules as well.

```bash
23:01:42  │ Error: Failed to query available provider packages
23:01:42  │ 
23:01:42  │ Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider
23:01:42  │ hashicorp/grafana: provider registry registry.terraform.io does not have a
23:01:42  │ provider named registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/grafana
23:01:42  │ 
23:01:42  │ Did you intend to use grafana/grafana? If so, you must specify that source
23:01:42  │ address in each module which requires that provider. To see which modules
23:01:42  │ are currently depending on hashicorp/grafana, run the following command:
23:01:42  │     terraform providers
```
