In today's complex enterprise environments, managing infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts has become standard practice. Whether you're implementing a landing zone architecture, enforcing organizational policies, or deploying consistent resources, doing this manually across dozens or hundreds of accounts quickly becomes unmanageable. This is where AWS CloudFormation StackSets shinesâ€”allowing you to deploy identical stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through implementing cross-account infrastructure using CloudFormation StackSets. You'll learn the practical steps to establish a foundation for multi-account resource management that can scale with your organization.

## Why Multi-Account Architecture Matters

Before diving into implementation, let's understand why organizations adopt multi-account strategies:

* **Security Isolation**: Separate workloads and data based on security requirements
    
* **Cost Management**: Track and allocate costs to specific business units
    
* **Blast Radius Containment**: Limit the impact of incidents to a single account
    
* **Governance Alignment**: Match AWS accounts to organizational structure
    
* **Compliance Requirements**: Segregate regulated workloads from non-regulated ones
    

However, this architecture introduces a significant challenge: how do you efficiently deploy and manage resources across all these accounts? Enter `CloudFormation StackSets`.

## Understanding Self-Managed StackSets

For cross-account deployments, AWS offers two permission models: `SELF_MANAGED` and `SERVICE_MANAGED`. In this implementation, we'll use the `SELF_MANAGED` approach, which requires creating two IAM roles:

* `AdministrationRole`: Lives in the management account(root account of the organization) and allows CloudFormation to assume execution roles in target accounts
    
* `ExecutionRole`: Lives in each target account and grants permissions to create resources
    

Let's break down the implementation step by step.

### Step 1: Creating the Administration Role

First, we need to create the CloudFormation StackSet Administration Role in the management account:

1. Navigate to `CloudFormation` &gt; `StackSets` &gt; `Create StackSet`
    
2. Leave the `IAM` role and `ExecutionRole` fields empty (we're creating these roles)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1746733595835/a8ff3152-c546-41c8-b42f-91613f9720fb.png align="center")
    
3. Upload the following template:
    
    ```yaml
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Description: >
      Creates the CloudFormation StackSet Administration Role in the management account.
      This role allows CloudFormation to assume execution roles in target accounts.
    Parameters:
      RootAccountId:
        Type: String
        Description: The root account ID of the main AWS account
    Resources:
      StackSetAdministrationRole:
        Type: AWS::IAM::Role
        Properties:
          RoleName: !Sub "AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole-${RootAccountId}"
          AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Principal:
                  Service: "cloudformation.amazonaws.com"
                Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
          Policies:
            - PolicyName: "AssumeExecutionRolePolicy"
              PolicyDocument:
                Version: "2012-10-17"
                Statement:
                  - Effect: Allow
                    Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
                    Resource: "arn:aws:iam::*:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole-${RootAccountId}"
    Outputs:
      AdministrationRoleArn:
        Description: "ARN of the StackSet Administration Role"
        Value: !GetAtt StackSetAdministrationRole.Arn
    ```
    
4. Complete the StackSet creation by specifying a name, description, and your management account ID under "Account numbers"
    
5. Specify the deployment region and submit.
    

This template creates an IAM role that CloudFormation service can assume to orchestrate cross-account deployments. The policy attached to this role allows it to assume the execution role in target accounts.

## Step 2: Creating the Execution Role

Next, we need to create the CloudFormation StackSet Execution Role that will be deployed to all target accounts:

1. Navigate to `CloudFormation` &gt; `StackSets` &gt; `Create StackSet`
    
2. Leave the `IAM` role and `ExecutionRole` fields empty (same as while creating Administrative Role)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1746733797055/91f72fda-f940-406b-a293-be29d57b318b.png align="center")
    
3. Upload a template that creates the execution role with permissions for your specific resource types:
    
    ```yaml
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Description: >
      Creates the CloudFormation StackSet Execution Role in target accounts.
      This role is assumed by the administration role and has permissions for
      resource management.
    Parameters:
      RootAccountId:
        Type: String
        Description: The root account ID of the main AWS account
    Resources:
      StackSetExecutionRole:
        Type: AWS::IAM::Role
        Properties:
          RoleName: !Sub "AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole-${RootAccountId}"
          AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Principal:
                  AWS:
                    - !Sub "arn:aws:iam::${RootAccountId}:root"
                Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
          ManagedPolicyArns:
            - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"  # Be as restrictive as possible for production env
    Outputs:
      ExecutionRoleArn:
        Description: "ARN of the StackSet Execution Role"
        Value: !GetAtt StackSetExecutionRole.Arn
    ```
    
4. Complete the `StackSet` creation with a name and description
    
5. Under "Account numbers," add all target accounts as comma-separated values
    
6. Specify the deployment region and submit.
    

### Step 3: Deploying Infrastructure Across Accounts

Now that we have the foundation set up, we can deploy actual infrastructure across our accounts. Let's create a simple example that establishes a standardized S3 bucket for logging in each account:

1. Navigate to `CloudFormation` &gt; `StackSets` &gt; `Create StackSet`
    
2. Select the `AdministrationRole` and specify the `ExecutionRole` name
    
3. Upload a template that creates your resources:
    
    ```yaml
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Description: Creates standardized resources across accounts
    Resources:
      CentralizedLogBucket:
        Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
        Properties:
          BucketName: !Sub "centralized-logs-${AWS::AccountId}"
          VersioningConfiguration:
            Status: Enabled
          BucketEncryption:
            ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
              - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
                  SSEAlgorithm: AES256
          PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
            BlockPublicAcls: true
            BlockPublicPolicy: true
            IgnorePublicAcls: true
            RestrictPublicBuckets: true
          LifecycleConfiguration:
            Rules:
              - Id: TransitionToGlacierAndEventuallyExpire
                Status: Enabled
                ExpirationInDays: 2555  # ~7 years
                Transitions:
                  - TransitionInDays: 90
                    StorageClass: STANDARD_IA
                  - TransitionInDays: 365
                    StorageClass: GLACIER
      LogBucketPolicy:
        Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
        Properties:
          Bucket: !Ref CentralizedLogBucket
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: '2012-10-17'
            Statement:
              - Sid: DenyUnencryptedObjectUploads
                Effect: Deny
                Principal: '*'
                Action: 's3:PutObject'
                Resource: !Sub '${CentralizedLogBucket.Arn}/*'
                Condition:
                  StringNotEquals:
                    's3:x-amz-server-side-encryption': 'AES256'
    Outputs:
      LogBucketName:
        Description: "Centralized logging bucket name"
        Value: !Ref CentralizedLogBucket
      LogBucketArn:
        Description: "Centralized logging bucket ARN"
        Value: !GetAtt CentralizedLogBucket.Arn
    ```
    
4. Add your target accounts and deploy to the desired regions.
    

### Real-World Applications

The simple S3 bucket example is just the beginning. Here are some common infrastructure patterns deployed with StackSets:

#### 1\. Network Infrastructure

Deploy consistent VPC configurations across accounts:

```yaml
Resources:
  StandardVPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Sub "10.${AccountNumberSuffix}.0.0/16"
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub "standard-vpc-${AWS::AccountId}"
  
  # Subnets, route tables, etc.
```

#### 2\. IAM Policies and Roles

Establish baseline permissions and security guardrails:

```yaml
Resources:
  ReadOnlyRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      RoleName: "OrganizationReadOnlyRole"
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: !Sub "arn:aws:iam::${ManagementAccountId}:root"
            Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
      ManagedPolicyArns:
        - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess"
```

## Architecture Design Patterns

When designing multi-account infrastructure, consider these patterns:

### Hub and Spoke

The management account (hub) deploys and manages resources in target accounts (spokes). This centralized approach works well for governance, security, and compliance resources.

### Service-Specific Accounts

Dedicate accounts to specific shared services like networking, security, or logging. Use `StackSets` to establish connections between these service accounts and workload accounts.

### Regional Deployment Strategy

For global organizations, consider regional deployment strategies:

* Deploy to all regions simultaneously
    
* Deploy region by region
    
* Maintain region-specific configurations via parameters
    

---

## Advanced StackSets Features

### Stack Set Operations Options

CloudFormation StackSets provides several options to control deployment behavior:

* **Maximum Concurrent Accounts**: Control how many accounts receive updates simultaneously
    
* **Failure Tolerance**: Define how many account failures are acceptable before halting deployment
    
* **Region Concurrency**: Specify if regions should be updated in parallel or sequentially
    
* **Retain Stacks**: Choose if stacks should remain when removed from the StackSet
    

### Parameter Overrides

Use parameter overrides to customize deployments for specific accounts or regions:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
  --stack-set-name NetworkInfrastructure \
  --template-body file://network-template.yaml \
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey=VpcCidr,ParameterValue=10.0.0.0/16 \
    ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=Production
```

Then override parameters for specific deployments:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name NetworkInfrastructure \
  --accounts 111122223333 \
  --regions us-east-1 \
  --parameter-overrides \
    ParameterKey=VpcCidr,ParameterValue=10.1.0.0/16 \
    ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=Development
```

### Integration with AWS Organizations

If using AWS Organizations, consider moving to SERVICE\_MANAGED permissions mode:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
  --stack-set-name OrganizationDeployment \
  --template-body file://template.yaml \
  --permission-model SERVICE_MANAGED \
  --auto-deployment Enabled=true,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval=false
```

This allows you to deploy to organizations or organizational units (OUs) rather than specifying account IDs:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name OrganizationDeployment \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-examplerootid-exampleouid \
  --regions us-east-1
```
